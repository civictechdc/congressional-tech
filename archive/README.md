# Civic & Congressional Tech Project Proposals

We're establishing a relationship with key technical personel in and around congress, this is an aggregated list of problems that have been identified, and are potential project ideas.

**Overarching Goal:** Enhance congressional operations, transparency, and public access to information through targeted civic technology projects.

This is based on the this [wiki](https://github.com/DanielSchuman/Policy/wiki/Leg-Tech) by [DanielSchuman](https://github.com/DanielSchuman)

    Proposed technical solution:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Form scraping:</strong> A GitHub Actions workflow runs Playwright to scrape live Google Forms from all participating Members of Congress. For each form, it extracts all visible labels, input types, and field metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuzzy matching & mapping:</strong> Each scraped formâ€™s fields are run through a fuzzy matching engine that adds them to a growing canonical list of standardized field names. This process builds a crosswalk: a mapping from each live label to a canonical schema key (e.g., mapping "Title of Project" â†’ "Project Name"). The result is stored in a <code>translations.csv</code> (or JSON) file, associating each MOCâ€™s form fields with standardized identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Schema & version publishing:</strong> The <code>translations.csv</code> and a <code>version.txt</code> file (containing a hash) are published publicly (committed to the repo and accessed by `raw.githubusercontent.com`) for use by the template sheet and chrome/firefox extension.</li>
        <li><strong>Template Sheet:</strong> A read-only Google Sheet imports <code>translations.csv</code> into a hidden sheet using <code>=IMPORTDATA</code>. A second, visible, sheet exposes only the ~15 common input columns. The hidden sheet uses formulas to reference the visible columns based on the precomputed mappings from <code>translations.csv</code>, generating values for all 500 canonical fields without additional user input.</li>
        <li><strong>Version enforcement:</strong> The sheet also imports the remote <code>version.txt</code> into a designated cell (ABG: there needs to be a hard copy step at template duplication otherwise this will be a circular reference). The Chrome extension checks this value against the latest published value (by accessing it itself). If thereâ€™s a mismatch, the extension blocks execution, ensuring users donâ€™t submit data using an outdated template sheet. </li>
        <li><strong>Staffer workflow:</strong> Staffers duplicate the template and enter their data in the ~15 visible fields. Once ready, they click the Chrome extension to begin the guided submission process.</li>
        <li><strong>Chrome Extension:</strong> The extension loads the full ~500 field values from the hidden sheet values into memory (ABG: or if necessary don't hide the sheet, point is to avoid auth by scraping the values directly from the open tab) and presents a UI showing submission progress. The extension will navigate the user to each MOC's form and autofill in the correct inputs from the ~500 field values on the live Google Form. The staffer manually reviews each form and submits. After each form, they advance to the next using the extension UI.</li>
    </ol>
    ABG: Could also build out the Chrome extension such that clicking it from any page that isn't the template will duplicate a new template for you and navigate you to it. For the proposed enhancement, that would require live fuzzy matching which would require a backend and an API. Very different solution required-- unfortunately. Could look into browser-based fuzzy matching solutions with web assembly.
