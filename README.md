## Git LFS Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è This repository uses [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.com/).Ô∏è Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

You **must** install Git LFS before cloning or working with this repo.

### Install Git LFS

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

Linux (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS):

```bash
sudo dnf install git-lfs
```

Windows:
	‚Ä¢	Download and run the installer from https://git-lfs.com/
	‚Ä¢	Or install via Chocolatey:

```bash
choco install git-lfs
```

### Initialize Git LFS

Run this once after installing:

```bash
git lfs install
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you don‚Äôt install Git LFS then running `git clone` will result in the following error message:
```bash
git-lfs filter-process: git-lfs: command not found
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
warning: Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.
You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'
```
in which case you must delete the directory, install Git LFS following the instructions above, and try again.

## Development Containers

üê≥ This repository includes [Development Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration for a consistent development environment.

### Quick Start with Devcontainers

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone this repository (Git LFS will be automatically configured)
2. Open the repository in VS Code
3. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**
4. Wait for the container to build and initialize (~3-5 minutes first time)

**What's Included:**
- **Ubuntu 22.04** base environment
- **Python 3.11** with all project dependencies pre-installed
- **Node.js 20** for the Next.js web application
- **Git LFS** pre-configured and initialized
- **VS Code extensions** for Python, TypeScript, and web development
