# Refetch the twelve Oct 31 Wayback bodies not in raw

The twelve October 31 Wayback replay target/body pairs (ct-umtm) are recorded as not in raw: ledger .cache/archive-release/implementation/ct-umtm-20261108/wayback-not-in-raw.json. If wanted, refetch each exact Wayback body once through the maintained capture/recovery path (capture_schedule + retained import, as ct-rie2 did for USAID), verify its body hash against the ledger, and import only on qualified identity. Out of scope: proving semantic equivalence; one CHRG-110hhrg41994 counterpart is a possible but unproved match.
